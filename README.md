# Machine-Learning-and-NLP
Various application based excercise projects to help me uderstand Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing Algorithms. 

### Machine Learning:
1. Decision Tree with Information Gain and Gini and Post Pruning:  Implementation in Java. Apply splits on attributes using chosen heuristic. Build decision tree using Binary Tree Data Structure. Traversing the tree to classify training set. Pruning decision tree for over fitting using Validation data.
2. Mutlinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for Spam Email Filtering: Using training data of 500 emails build 2 classifiers. Used Nested Hash Maps to store words and related count and probability information. Also tried out various parameters to improve performance of algorithms.

### Natural Language Processing:
1. Sentence Probabilities with Bigrams: Implemented a probabilistic system, which calculates Bigram frequencies of word pairs from corpus of training data. Applied various smoothing techniques like Laplace Smoothing and Good Turing Discounting. Determine which of the given test sentences have a better probaility. Worked on financial expertise domain.
2. Viterbi Algorithm for Hidden Markov Models: Implemented the Viterbi Algorithm using dynamic programming approach. To determine the hidden states based on unrealted obervations.
